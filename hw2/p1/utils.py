    # Some useful tips if it takes too long time                                     #
    #   1. you don't necessarily need to perform SIFT on all images, although it     #
    #      would be better to do so                                                  #
    #   2. you can randomly sample the descriptors from each image to save memory    #
    #      and speed up the clustering, which means you don't have to get as many    #
    #      SIFT features as you will in get_bags_of_sift(), because you're only      #
    #      trying to get a representative sample here                                #
    #   3. the default step size in dsift() is [1, 1], which works better but        #
    #      usually become very slow, you can use larger step size to speed up        #
    #      without sacrificing too much performance                                  #
    #   4. we recommend debugging with the 'fast' parameter in dsift(), this         #
    #      approximate version of SIFT is about 20 times faster to compute           #
    # You are welcome to use your own SIFT feature                                   #
